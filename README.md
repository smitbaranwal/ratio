Integrating the tool on payment gateways lets you identify the nature of the transaction at the time of the transaction &amp; generate these reports with the click integrated tool. Ratio is an advanced online accounting and analytical software that is specifically designed to support the growth of businesses operating in the web3 ecosystem. In partnership with Parcel Inc., Ratio has introduced new features to automate NFT accounting for businesses, making it easier to report primary and secondary income, categorize transactions automatically, and maintain robust documentation of capital gains and losses in compliance standards.

* [Operators] Ratio provides real-time P&L across their accounts, enabling them to achieve world-class financial planning.
* [Accountants] Accountants can benefit from powerful integrations across crypto platforms and accounting software, which can help them unlock new client segments. 
* [Auditors] Auditors can easily verify and reconcile transactions across all wallets, exchanges, banks, and custodians in one place.




<!-- ## Backend
Ratio uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about), As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop.

```bash
# For npm
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# For yarn
yarn install
```

3. Now, you are ready to start the server with the help of command shown below. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to check your development üöÄ.

## Login

To begin using Ratio and authorize with Metamask as a blockchain wallet, follow these steps:

1. Install the Metamask extension on Google Chrome using [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en-GB).

2. Click "Add to Chrome" and follow the prompts to create a new wallet or import an existing one. Accept the terms and conditions and choose a new password for your wallet.

3. Follow the recommended flow to generate a secret word phrase, which will be used as a recovery password. Click "Reveal Secret Word Phrase" to see a 12-word phrase, copy it and keep it safe for future use. Click "Next" and complete the phrase you generated in the previous step.

4. Pin the Metamask extension from the list of extensions, so that it will always be visible on Chrome tabs.

5. To connect to the Ratio app, go to [Local Environment](http://localhost:3000/pages/login) or [Production Environment](https://fin-grow.vercel.app/pages/login) and click "Connect Wallet".

6. Select "Metamask" from the list of wallets and authorize the Ratio app to access your public key accounts.

7. Click "Next" and then "Connect". Select one safe address which pops up after authorizing using the "Connect" button.
